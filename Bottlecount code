#Write a program that will allow a grocery store to keep track of the total number of bottles collected 
# for seven days.
#The program will calculate the total number of bottles returned for the week and the amount paid out 
# (the total returned times .10 cents). 
#The output of the program should include the total number of bottles returned and the total paid out.  
#The program will ask the user if they have more data to enter and will end the program if they do not. 

#total_bottles = 0
#todays_bottles = 0
#total_payout = 0
#counter = 0

keepGoing = 'y'
while keepGoing == 'y':
    input("Do you want to enter another week's worth of data?\n(Enter: y or n)? ")

    nmbr_of_days = 7
    totalBottles = 0
    todaysBottles = 0
    counter = 0
    while counter < nmbr_of_days:
        todaysBottles = input("Enter number of bottles returned for day #",counter, ":")
        totalBottles = todaysBottles + totalBottles
        counter =  counter + 1 or += 1
    #totalPayout = 0 // resets to 0 for multiple runs
    #total_payout = totalbottles * payout_per_botttle	
    payoutPerBottle = 0.10
    totalPayout = totalBottles * payoutPerBottle
    #The total number of bottles collected is 2475
    #The total paid out is $ 247.5
    print('The total number of bottles collected is', totalBottles)

    print('The total paid out is $', '{:.1f}', str(totalPayout))
